This project focuses on building a predictive machine learning model to detect spam messages using the SMS Spam Collection dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, applying the scikit-learn library for implementation and evaluation. The workflow begins with downloading and importing the dataset, which contains labeled text messages as either “ham” (legitimate) or “spam” (unwanted/advertisement), and then performing basic preprocessing to prepare the raw text for modeling. Preprocessing steps involve converting text to lowercase, removing URLs, numbers, and punctuation, and stripping extra whitespace to ensure that only meaningful words remain. Once cleaned, the dataset is split into training and testing sets, maintaining class balance through stratification to prevent bias toward the majority class. The core of the model pipeline uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to convert text data into numerical feature vectors that capture the importance of words relative to the dataset, followed by a Logistic Regression classifier, chosen for its efficiency and interpretability in binary classification problems. To enhance performance, GridSearchCV is employed for hyperparameter tuning, testing different TF-IDF configurations such as n-gram ranges and maximum document frequency, along with varying the Logistic Regression regularization parameter (C) to find the best combination for maximizing the F1-score. Once trained, the model is evaluated on the test set using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC metrics, providing a balanced understanding of its predictive ability, especially in identifying spam without too many false positives. A confusion matrix visualization is generated using Seaborn heatmaps to clearly display the number of correctly and incorrectly classified messages for both ham and spam categories. The ROC AUC score further demonstrates the model’s ability to distinguish between the two classes across various classification thresholds. After confirming satisfactory performance, the trained model is saved to disk using Joblib, allowing it to be loaded and reused without retraining. To demonstrate its practical application, a few example text messages are passed through the saved model, showing real-time classification into spam or ham categories. This project showcases the complete lifecycle of a text classification problem—from data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation, to model deployment. The choice of Logistic Regression with TF-IDF is both computationally efficient and robust for short text classification tasks like spam detection, and the methodology can be extended to other domains such as email filtering, sentiment analysis, or fake news detection. The notebook format ensures that each step is documented, visualized, and reproducible, making it easy to understand for learners while also being applicable in real-world scenarios where automated spam detection is essential for improving communication security and user experience. By integrating exploratory analysis, machine learning, and evaluation metrics, the project serves as a solid, end-to-end example of applying NLP and predictive modeling techniques effectively.
